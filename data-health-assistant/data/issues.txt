Regular recipe issues:
- Ingredient in recipe not found in item list
- Non-numerical ingredient quantity
- Wrong item unit of measure (should only be g, kg, l, ml, ea) or not matching the item unit of measure
- Incorrect ingredient quantity added leading to very high recipe cost (e.g. 20,000ml instead of 200ml)
